		<p>Hi! I'm Justin!<br/>
			I'm a sound designer and engineer based in New York City with a focus on pushing the boundaries of using sound-interactive technology in theatre. I'm a recent graduate from Hampshire College, with a Liberal Arts degree in Theatrical Sound Design and Computer Science. I have designed 16 shows over the last three years, with much of my work at Hampshire and in New York being focused around creating immersive sound designs in full collaboration with the director and design team, to create a compelling world for the audience.<br/><br/>
			I'm interested in software engineering to expand my skillset to create audio for video games and to work with 3-dimensional audio in VR.
